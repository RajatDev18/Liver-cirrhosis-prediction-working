## Liver Cirrhosis Stage Detection

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the stage of liver cirrhosis using clinical and biochemical patient data. The dataset is derived from a Mayo Clinic study on Primary Biliary Cirrhosis conducted between 1974 and 1984.

The system performs data cleaning, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and model training to classify liver disease into histologic stages. Multiple supervised learning algorithms are evaluated to identify the most effective model for stage prediction based on medical indicators such as bilirubin, albumin, cholesterol, liver enzymes, platelet count, and clinical symptoms.

The objective is to demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow for medical classification problems, including preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Task Type: Multi-class Classification
Output: Cirrhosis stage prediction (Stage 1, 2, or 3)
